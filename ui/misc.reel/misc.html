                <p>Montage works best in modern browsers. The following browsers have been tested extensively:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recent stable versions of Chrome</li>
                    <li>Safari 5.1</li>
                    <li>Android browser (Ice Cream Sandwich)</li>
                    <li>Safari mobile (iOS 5)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Recent versions of Firefox mostly work with minor issues.
                    We hope to support IE 10 and Opera 12 but there's work to be done on both sides.</p>
